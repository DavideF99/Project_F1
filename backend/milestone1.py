    Start date: Monday 4 August 2025 🗓️

    This is the start of a project that I hope will help me learn useful Python skills and help me build something that interests me. 

    The aim of this project is to build an F1 web-app that is capable of providing static and dynamic dashboards. Hopefully I can create a working analytics F1 dashboard before the end of the F1 summer break 2025! 🏎️
